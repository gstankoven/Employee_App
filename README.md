# employee_app
employee app with CRUD, REST API, and React application

I created an application that can create, delete, and update a list of employees to a database.
This was the first time I used the React Table so a bit of time was needed to get an understanding of it,
but after getting use to it I found it to be very helpful.
The client side api calls use the axios module.
The server side api uses express.
